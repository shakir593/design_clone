<p>Earnings Disclaimer</p>

<p>Effective June 2023</p>

<p>Clever Investor emails every purchaser of its “Mentoring,” “Fast Track Profit System,” and “Your First Flip” programs and asks them to participate in a survey related to their participation in these programs.</p>

<p>The surveys are conducted with a view toward determining the average or "typical" results of program participants. 184 "Mentoring" students responded; 580 students responded to the survey for "Fast Track Profit Systems;" and 63 students responded to the survey for "Your First Flip."</p>

<p>Not all survey respondents responded to every question. </p>

<p>The survey process began in January, 2017. Surveys are anonymous and were promoted as such to encourage honest responses.  IP addresses were tracked and participants were unable to submit more than one survey to maintain the integrity of overall results.</p>

<p>There are certainly many variables to take into account in determining what are the typical experiences and results of Clever Investor students.  The surveys take into account: prior experience, time expended, scope of the courses that were completed, program satisfaction, and types of transactions.  Please note that geographic location was not included and real estate activity, property values and profit potential is greatly affected by specific market conditions. </p>


<p>The results of each survey are summarized below.</p>
